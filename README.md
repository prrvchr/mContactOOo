**The use of this software subjects you to our** [**Terms Of Use**][3] **and** [**Data Protection Policy**][4]

# version [0.0.1][5]

## Introduction:

**mContactOOo** is part of a [Suite][6] of [LibreOffice][7] and/or [OpenOffice][8] extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension gives you access to your Microsoft Outlook contacts in LibreOffice / OpenOffice.

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code][9].
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue][10] if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.  
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

mContactOOo uses a local [HsqlDB][11] database version 2.7.1.  
HsqlDB being a database written in Java, its use requires the [installation and configuration][12] in LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 11 or later**.  
I recommend [Adoptium][13] as your Java installation source.

If you are using **LibreOffice on Linux**, you need to make sure of two things:
  - You are subject to [bug 139538][14]. To work around the problem, please **uninstall the packages** with commands:
    - `sudo apt remove libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb`
    - `sudo apt remove libhsqldb1.8.0-java`

  If you still want to use the Embedded HsqlDB functionality provided by LibreOffice, then install the [HsqlDBembeddedOOo][15] extension.  

  - If the python3-cffi-backend package is installed then you need to **install the python3-cffi package** with the command:
    - `dpkg -s python3-cffi-backend` (to know if the package is installed)
    - `sudo apt install python3-cffi`

OpenOffice and LibreOffice on Windows are not subject to this malfunction.

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

- Install ![OAuth2OOo logo][16] **[OAuth2OOo.oxt][17]** extension version 0.0.6.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![jdbcDriverOOo logo][18] **[jdbcDriverOOo.oxt][19]** extension version 0.0.4.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![mContactOOo logo][1] **[mContactOOo.oxt][20]** extension version 0.0.1.

Restart LibreOffice / OpenOffice after installation.

## Use:

In LibreOffice / OpenOffice go to **File -> Wizards -> Address Data Source**:

![mContactOOo screenshot 5][25]

After authorizing the [OAuth2OOo][26] application to access your Contacts, normally you should see: Connection Test: The connection was established successfully.

## Historical:

### Introduction:

This extension was written in order to make usable in free software (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) your personal data stored in your Microsoft Outlook address book.

With the [smtpMailerOOo][31] extension, it can be the data source for [mail merge][32] by email, to your correspondents contained in your Microsoft Outlook address book.

It will give you access to an information system that only larges companies are able, today, to implement.
