# version [1.0.0][5]

## Introduction:

**mContactOOo** is part of a [Suite][6] of [LibreOffice][7] ~~and/or [OpenOffice][8]~~ extensions allowing to offer you innovative services in these office suites.  
This extension gives you access, in LibreOffice, to your Microsoft Outlook contacts.

Being free software I encourage you:
- To duplicate its [source code][9].
- To make changes, corrections, improvements.
- To open [issue][10] if needed.

In short, to participate in the development of this extension.  
Because it is together that we can make Free Software smarter.

## Requirement:

In order to take advantage of the latest versions of the Python libraries used in mContactOOo, version 2 of Python has been abandoned in favor of **Python 3.8 minimum**.  
This means that **mContactOOo no longer supports OpenOffice and LibreOffice 6.x on Windows since version 1.0.0**.
I can only advise you **to migrate to LibreOffice 7.x**.

mContactOOo uses a local [HsqlDB][12] database version 2.7.1.  
HsqlDB being a database written in Java, its use requires the [installation and configuration][13] in LibreOffice / OpenOffice of a **JRE version 11 or later**.  
I recommend [Adoptium][14] as your Java installation source.

If you are using **LibreOffice on Linux**, you are subject to [bug 139538][15]. To work around the problem, please **uninstall the packages** with commands:
- `sudo apt remove libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb` (to uninstall the libreoffice-sdbc-hsqldb package)
- `sudo apt remove libhsqldb1.8.0-java` (to uninstall the libhsqldb1.8.0-java package)

If you still want to use the Embedded HsqlDB functionality provided by LibreOffice, then install the [HsqlDBembeddedOOo][16] extension.  

## Installation:

It seems important that the file was not renamed when it was downloaded.
If necessary, rename it before installing it.

- Install ![OAuth2OOo logo][17] **[OAuth2OOo.oxt][18]** extension version 1.1.0.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![jdbcDriverOOo logo][19] **[jdbcDriverOOo.oxt][20]** extension version 0.0.4.

You must install this extension, if it is not already installed.

- Install ![mContactOOo logo][1] **[mContactOOo.oxt][21]** extension version 1.0.0.

Restart LibreOffice / OpenOffice after installation.

## Use:

In LibreOffice / OpenOffice go to **File -> Wizards -> Address Data Source**:

Then:

![mContactOOo screenshot 5][26]

After authorizing the [OAuth2OOo][27] application to access your Contacts, normally you should see: Connection Test: The connection was established successfully.

* LibreOffice 7.5.4.2(x86) - Windows 10 - Python version 3.8.16 - Adoptium JDK Hotspot 11.0.19 (under Lubuntu 22.04 / VirtualBox 6.1.38)

* **Does not work with OpenOffice on Windows** see [bug 128569][11]. Having no solution, I encourage you to install **LibreOffice**.

I encourage you in case of problem :-(  
to create an [issue][10]  
I will try to solve it ;-)

## Historical:

### Introduction:

This extension was written in order to make usable in free software (LibreOffice or OpenOffice) your personal data stored in your Microsoft Outlook address book.

With the [smtpMailerOOo][32] extension, it can be the data source for [mail merge][33] by email, to your correspondents contained in your Microsoft Outlook address book.

It will give you access to an information system that only larges companies are able, today, to implement.
